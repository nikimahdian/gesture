Prompt to Improve Left/Right Gesture Detection and Reduce Sensitivity

The system is too sensitive and doesn't recognize left and right gestures reliably anymore, due to smoothing, thresholds, and majority voting adjustments. To address this, follow these steps:

Reduce Movement Threshold for Left/Right Gestures:

Set a lower movement threshold for left and right gestures (e.g., 5 pixels) to ensure subtle hand movements are detected without ignoring them.

Only trigger left/right gestures when the wrist (or center of the hand) moves more than the set threshold.

Adjust Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Smoothing:

Set the smoothing factor (alpha) to 0.1 for more responsive dynamic gesture detection. Lower values help the system track left and right gestures without smoothing them too much, allowing the system to remain responsive to hand movements.

Reduce Majority Voting Window for Faster Recognition:

Use a smaller majority voting window (e.g., 3 to 5 frames) to confirm gestures faster and prevent unnecessary delay or missed gestures. This ensures that small, transient shakes do not affect the final decision.

Focus on Horizontal Displacement (x-axis) for Left/Right Gestures:

Ensure that the displacement for left/right gestures is based primarily on horizontal movement (x-axis) rather than overall hand motion. This avoids accidental recognition of gestures from vertical or random movements.

Only detect left or right if there is significant movement along the x-axis (e.g., the wrist moving beyond a certain threshold).

Debug Output for Testing:

Add debug output to monitor the displacement, smoothed positions, and gesture detection. This will help in fine-tuning the thresholds and smoothing settings to ensure reliable recognition.

Objective:

Improve left/right gesture recognition without making the system overly sensitive to small shakes.

Ensure dynamic gestures (like left and right) are detected based on significant movement, not noise or small shakes.

Maintain a balance between smoothing and responsiveness for reliable gesture detection.
